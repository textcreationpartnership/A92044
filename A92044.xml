            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> birth-day, where we may hope this Nurſing Father of our Church will with his ſword which He bears not in vain, prove as great a Defender of the faith once delivered to the Saints, as the other Holy Father did with his pen, and we made as happy in this Crown and Scepter, as the Antient Church was in that <hi>Miter</hi> and <hi>Croſier.

The Heavens ſeemed to congratulate his royal birth, a Star appearing at mid-day over St. <hi>James,</hi> diſplaying its modeſt beams in ſpight of Sun-ſhine in the middle of the Air, <hi>(an embleme of his future glory,)</hi> Thus did the Heavens expreſs themſelves in miracles and wonders; and it is our duty to admire them, as the works of the Lord, and therefore wonderful in our eyes: Yet the great <hi>Selden</hi> attempted to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that Star thus:

                  <l>When to <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs the greatful King drew near?</l>
                  <l>A ſhining Star did in the Heavens appear,</l>

            <p>The King our Soveraigns Father being ſenſible that Children to any man eſpecially to a Prince are an inheritance from the Lord, went ſolemnly to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> (once a Cathedral, ſince a ſtable; once a Church to entertain Chriſt in, ſince a Manger for Rebels to revel in) and there acknowledged with the Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe, that by God, and through God, and therefore to Him, and the glory of his praiſe are all things.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168915:3"/>
            <p>This Bud of Majeſty was committed to the care of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Counteſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> to be by her tender hands, and softer care cheriſhed to grow up a Soveraign, where He ſucked graces in with milk, and vertues as early as nouriſhment; as appears by the moſt incomparable gifts and graces wherewith God hath bin pleaſed to endow his Majeſty. To paſs by his outward Man, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, and with <hi>Saul</hi> higher then all the people, ſo that there is <hi>none</hi> like him among all the people; ſo exactly formed, that with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon</hi> from the Crown of his head to the ſoul of his foot the moſt curious eye could not diſcern an error or a ſpot; the pleaſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and ſoft rigorouſneſs of that face which is both Majeſtick and beautiful, ſolemn and comely; though of late he is grown leaner with cares and age; the dark and night complexion of his face, and the twin-ſtars of his quick and ſharp eyes ſparkling in that night; He is moſt beautiful when he ſpeaks, his black ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Locks naturally curled into great Rings hath hitherto been his Ornament and Crown; his motions eaſie and graceful, and plainly Majeſtick! &amp;c.

His vaſt Underſtanding, as ſpreading, and as wide as the things to be underſtood; three Nations put limits to his power, its the world onely that confines his thoughts. His Majeſty underſtands <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> writes <hi>French</hi> correctly; the <hi>French, Italian, Spaniards,</hi> (like thoſe <hi>Parthians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Elamites</hi> in the Acts) are amazed to hear Him, replying to each of them in their own Tongue wherein they were born. In theſe ſeveral Languages he peruſeth ſuch parts of knowledge as may compleat a Soveraign: Logick ſeems to be his Nature as well as Reaſon, He cannot ſpeak incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently. He hath read divers of the choiceſt pieces of policy, &amp; gathered the ſcattered wiſdom and reaſon that run through Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians writings and actions in his own breaſt, and there digeſted them into axiomes of an entire and well framed policy; to policy He hath added ancient and modern Hiſtory; whereupon he ſeeth thoſe things performed, that He ſaw in policy contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Fidelity of Retention; for as Nature hath given to the bodies of men for the furtherance of Corporal ſtrength, a Retentive power to claſp and hold faſt that which preſerveth it, until a thorough concoction be wrought, ſo he hath a Retentive faculty of Memory given to Reaſon as a means to conſolidate and inrich it.</p>

But he hath a mercy that rejoyceth over his Juſtice, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy calculated for our time and Nation, wherein Subjects were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo obnoxious to Juſtice, nor a Prince ſo enclined to mercy; a People was hardly ever ſo guilty as we, and hardly a Prince ever ſo gratious as himſelf, we are not more ready to offend then he to pardon; with what tender Majeſty doth he paſs by the guilty proſtrate? his Juſtice doth but cut out work for his Mercy! what ſtubborn Offenders that brings upon their knees, this ſtoops to bring them up again; they that fall by his ſeverity, riſe up again by his favour; he is more compaſſionate to Men then they are to themſelves: It is but the leaſt part of his mercy that he can be merciful to others while they are moſt cruel to him, he is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the higheſt charity towards them, while they are exerciſing the greateſt injuries towards him; this Nature taught him, then God, and afterwards his Father, in that incomparable advice to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A general goodneſs, (whereof that mercy is but a branch) familiar converſe, eaſineſs of acceſs, a readineſs to communicate himſelf, his fair carriage towards all, how unwilling he is to force men to do him right, how (when he who fears not to do others juſtice) afraid is he to do it to himſelf? I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be more good then great, more <hi>Charlebone</hi> then <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine;</hi> I am ſure his virtues are eſteemed by him more then his Kingdome, and he doth not exerciſe theſe vertues (as malice, as Hell once ſuggeſted) that he might diſſemble himſelf to his juſt Right; but he would obtain his Right that he might be the more able to exerciſe his vertues; his Right will therefore pleaſe him, becauſe then he is able to forgive them that did him wrong.</p>
            <p n="6">6. His magnanimity, fortitude, and courage; he is as magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in ſuffering wrong, as he is valiant in attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Right; his <hi>Innocence being guilty of nothing, is afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> the Righteous is as bold as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> fearing no Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath juſtly provoked none; his Religion is not the leaſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168915:5"/>ſupport of his valour; He with <hi>David</hi> encourageth Gariſons, and wraps up himſelf in his God, where Reaſon leaves doubting, their Faith begins in hope even againſt hope. In a word, God hath indued His Majeſty with thoſe incomparable Graces that are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome poured forth any where below the Throne; for whatſoever things are true, juſt, pure, and lovely, they are in Him; This is the Perſon whom God and all Men think worthy of a Kingdom, but thoſe over whom He is a King; <hi>(meaning the Phanatique)</hi> theſe are the Vertues in whoſe enjoyment other Nations hug themſelves: Theſe are the Princely Rayes that ſhine with Majeſtick Luſtre in moſt parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> And this is the great and Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, who attributes not any thing to Himſelf, but with Holy King <hi>David,</hi> giveth the glory of all to the King of Kings, ſaying, <hi>I wil not truſt in my Bow, neither ſhall my Sword ſave me: But thou haſt ſaved us from our enemies, and haſt put them to ſhame that hated us;</hi> Or, as His Majeſty graciouſly expreſſed Himſelf in His ſhort Speech to the Miniſters, in his paſſage through the City:
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>The deliverance which God hath wrought for me, I own as the work of his own right hand, beyond humane contrivance, and deſire that all the glory of them may be aſcribed to Him.</hi>
