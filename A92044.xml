         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His great wi≈ødome, as of an Angel of God, as large a heart to know good and evil, as great education, the difference of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Factions he had to deal with, his Enemies oppo≈øition, his Friends treachery, his per≈øonal conver≈øe with men of all ≈øorts, the variety of his experience from the di≈øtinct knowledge of the Natures of the People of ≈øeveral Countreys of their chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of State Eccle≈øia≈øtick and Civil, and all this as a noble Pen ob≈øerves in adver≈øity, which opens the under≈øtanding, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the judgement, could make; he with his Grand-father of <hi>France</hi> carrieth a Councel with him upon one Hor≈øe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But this wi≈ødome were dangerous, were it not accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ju≈øtice, his wi≈ødom is not a crafty or ≈øordid ≈øubtilty, nor devili≈øh policie; but pure, good, and ju≈øt Judgement: He hath a Ju≈øtice that becomes the Throne, a con≈øtant will to give every
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168915:4"/>Man his due, as he hath well or ill de≈øerved: A per≈øon of Honour who hath ≈øpent 18 years in his Maje≈øties Court and ≈øervice, doth upon di≈øtinct knowledge let the World know he can as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that his Maje≈øty is ju≈øt as that he is a Man; he ob≈øerves a Ju≈øtice in his word, and in his action, the one is an <hi>Oracle,</hi> and the other Law.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But he hath a mercy that rejoyceth over his Ju≈øtice, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy calculated for our time and Nation, wherein Subjects were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo obnoxious to Ju≈øtice, nor a Prince ≈øo enclined to mercy; a People was hardly ever ≈øo guilty as we, and hardly a Prince ever ≈øo gratious as him≈øelf, we are not more ready to offend then he to pardon; with what tender Maje≈øty doth he pa≈øs by the guilty pro≈øtrate? his Ju≈øtice doth but cut out work for his Mercy! what ≈øtubborn Offenders that brings upon their knees, this ≈øtoops to bring them up again; they that fall by his ≈øeverity, ri≈øe up again by his favour; he is more compa≈ø≈øionate to Men then they are to them≈øelves: It is but the lea≈øt part of his mercy that he can be merciful to others while they are mo≈øt cruel to him, he is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing the highe≈øt charity towards them, while they are exerci≈øing the greate≈øt injuries towards him; this Nature taught him, then God, and afterwards his Father, in that incomparable advice to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A general goodne≈øs, (whereof that mercy is but a branch) familiar conver≈øe, ea≈øine≈øs of acce≈øs, a readine≈øs to communicate him≈øelf, his fair carriage towards all, how unwilling he is to force men to do him right, how (when he who fears not to do others ju≈øtice) afraid is he to do it to him≈øelf? I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be more good then great, more <hi>Charlebone</hi> then <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine;</hi> I am ≈øure his virtues are e≈øteemed by him more then his Kingdome, and he doth not exerci≈øe the≈øe vertues (as malice, as Hell once ≈øugge≈øted) that he might di≈ø≈øemble him≈øelf to his ju≈øt Right; but he would obtain his Right that he might be the more able to exerci≈øe his vertues; his Right will therefore plea≈øe him, becau≈øe then he is able to forgive them that did him wrong.</p>

His magnanimity, fortitude, and courage; he is as magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in ≈øuffering wrong, as he is valiant in attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Right; his <hi>Innocence being guilty of nothing, is afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> the Righteous is as bold as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> fearing no Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he hath ju≈øtly provoked none; his Religion is not the lea≈øt

In a word, God hath indued His Maje≈øty with tho≈øe incomparable Graces that are ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome poured forth any where below the Throne; for what≈øoever things are true, ju≈øt, pure, and lovely, they are in Him; This is the Per≈øon whom God and all Men think worthy of a Kingdom, but tho≈øe over whom He is a King; <hi>(meaning the Phanatique)</hi> the≈øe are the Vertues in who≈øe enjoyment other Nations hug them≈øelves: The≈øe are the Princely Rayes that ≈øhine with Maje≈øtick Lu≈øtre in mo≈øt parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> And this is the great and Chri≈øtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, who attributes not any thing to Him≈øelf, but with Holy King <hi>David,</hi> giveth the glory of all to the King of Kings, ≈øaying, <hi>I wil not tru≈øt in my Bow, neither ≈øhall my Sword ≈øave me: But thou ha≈øt ≈øaved us from our enemies, and ha≈øt put them to ≈øhame that hated us;</hi> Or, as His Maje≈øty graciou≈øly expre≈ø≈øed Him≈øelf in His ≈øhort Speech to the Mini≈øters, in his pa≈ø≈øage through the City:
